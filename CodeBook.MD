# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project
## GettingandCleaningProject


The purpose of this project is to demonstrate an ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. 
The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. 

It is required to submit: 
1) a tidy data set as described below, 
2) a link to a Github repository with your script for performing the analysis, and 
3) a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md. 

# This is the CodeBook.md file
