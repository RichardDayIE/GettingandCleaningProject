2) a link to a Github repository with your script for performing the analysis, and 
3) a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md. 
You should also include a README.md in the repo with your scripts. 
This repo explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.

# This is the README.md

There is a single r code filed in the repo called run_analysis.R.
This file will extract the data from the zip file and carry out the excercise that is required.

The codebook included describes the activities carried out - i.e. mainly the transformation in the
